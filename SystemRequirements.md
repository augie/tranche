**Installing Java**

You must have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5 in order to use this software. Currently, the JRE is not bundled with downloads of the code. If you do not have Java installed, you must download and install it. The JRE is free to download and use. Follow the links below to check if you have the required JRE and optionally download and install the JRE.


**Verify whether Java is already installed**

There are many ways to check if Java is installed on a computer. The steps given here should work for most every computer, but it is possible that Java is installed and the given steps will not be able to find it. In order to check if Java is installed, open up a command prompt and type 'java -version'. A few lines of text should appear containing the version of Java that is installed. Any version that starts with "1.5" should be fine, e.g. 'java version "1.5.0\_03"'.

If you don't have the correct version of Java installed, you will need to install Java.
