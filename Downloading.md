  * **Continue on Failure**: In the case that some part of the data set cannot be downloaded currently, you can choose to continue to download whatever is available or stop immediatley.
  * **Download Location**: The default download location will not suit most people.
  * **Pool Size**: The number of downloads that will occur at any one time. Larger pool size can make the most of network latency but requires more memory and processor resources. Setting to 0 makes the pool size unlimited.
  * **Servers**: Specify the servers that are to be used for this download. Typically, you should not change this or should only add to this list.
  * **Use Unspecified Servers**: Whether any servers that are available on the network should be used for the download or only the servers that you have specified.
  * **Validate**: When a download is validated, the downloaded materials are checked for validatity by recalculating the hash. This can make the download take longer.
