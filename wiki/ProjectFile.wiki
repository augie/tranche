The !ProjectFile is used to represent directory uploads, known as a "data set". This object contains the information that is necessary to reconstruct the directory during a download and is uploaded as a file to the repository after all other files have been uploaded. It is intended only for internal use, and is only stored temporarily on a client machine during a download. The hash of the !ProjectFile is the hash that represents the data set.

A !ProjectFile consists primarily of a collection of !ProjectFile parts. A !ProjectFile part consists of the relative name of the file (the directory structure plus the name of the file) and the hash of the meta data for the file. Unlike a file, the hash assigned to a data set depends on the naming of files on the uploading user's file system because a !ProjectFile part contains the relative name of a file in the directory, and thus changing the name of a file or directory will change the hash of the upload.
