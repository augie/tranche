*What is a Hash?*

A Hash is a string of characters that creates a unique identifier for a specific uploaded project, folder or file in Tranche. You will use a Hash to download data from Tranche.

Here is an example of what a Hash looks like:

}}}

Hashes are based on three different algorithms combined together and the file length. This creates a string of characters which we call a Hash. This Hash is a unique identifier to the data or project, you can think of it as a link. Unlike a link, a Tranche Hash will never suffer from "link rot," as it will always be the direct way to find and access the data from Tranche.

Below are the algorithms used to create the Hash:

  * MD5 (16 bytes)
  * SHA-1 (20 bytes)
  * SHA-256 (32 bytes)
  * File Lenth (8 bytes)
