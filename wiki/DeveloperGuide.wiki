=Design Principles=

Before we introduce how to create and manage networks, use more advanced tools or work with the API, there are a few introductory topics that explain the fundamentals of Tranche.

  * [https://trancheproject.org/admin/certificates.jsp Certificates and how authorization works in Tranche]
  * [https://trancheproject.org/users/hash.jsp What is a Hash?]
  * [https://trancheproject.org/admin/hashspan.jsp What is a Hash Span?]
  * Details on the Tranche file structure

=Starting a Tranche network=

In order to set up a Tranche network, you must create certificates and the proper configuration, as explained below. Before you get started, you will likely want to read through each of these in order to gain an understanding of the process of creating a network.

  * [CreateCerts Create your certificates]
  * [NetworkConfigs Create configuration files]
  * [NetworkJAR Create a JAR]
  * [ConfigureTools Configuring Tranche tools for your network]
  * [https://trancheproject.org/register.jsp Register your network with us (required for sending email through our servers)]
