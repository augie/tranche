Files stored on the repository are split into data chunks, each of which is a maximum of one megabyte in size. Each file that is uploaded has an associated meta data chunk, which contains an ordered list of all the data chunks, along with other useful information. The metadata chunk is important in both locating the data chunks for any file as well as reassembling that file. Data chunks and meta data may be referred to as "chunks" when there is no need to distinguish between the two.

A directory of files can be uploaded together; these uploads are interchangeably called a "data set" or a "project". When a data set is uploaded, a special file called the !ProjectFile is generated. This file is used internally by Tranche to describe the contents of the data set, and is downloaded by a client, then used to retrieve the meta data chunks for all the files and discarded from that client machine. Like any other file, the !ProjectFile has a meta data chunk that is used to locate the !ProjectFile data chunks and reassemble them. The hash for the !ProjectFile metadata chunk is considered the hash for the data set, and is used to download the entire data set.
